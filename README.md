**Accelerate Your Cloud Journey**

---

## Overview

BlissFlow maintains a curated collection of reusable Helm library charts to support and accelerate Kubernetes deployments.

Our Helm charts leverage a shared **Common** library, promoting consistency, modularity, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles across all deployments.

## What is a Helm Library Chart?

Introduced in [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/), a **library chart** provides reusable templates that other charts can consume. It allows you to centralize and standardize your Kubernetes resources.

Using a library chart:
- Reduces code duplication
- Simplifies maintenance
- Promotes best practices

## Why BlissFlow's Library?

At BlissFlow, we standardize Helm charts across projects by centralizing common configurations and patterns.  
Every chart we maintain depends on this **Common** library to ensure:
- Faster time-to-market
- Consistent deployments
- Scalable and maintainable infrastructure

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Amos-85/library-charts/tree/main/charts/stable/common#changelog) for release history and updates.
